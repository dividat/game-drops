# Time\_

# Time\_ units

Units of time, making it easier to specify things like a half-second
`(500 * millisecond)` without remembering Elmâ€™s underlying units of time.

{-| Type alias to make it clearer when you are working with durations.

Using the `Time_` helpers like `second` instead of raw numbers
is very highly recommended.
